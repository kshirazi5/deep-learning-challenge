# deep-learning-challenge

Overview:
The purpose of this challenge is to develop a neural networking model that can select applicants for funding with the best chance of success. Machine Learning and Neural Networking tools were used to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will have success when they revceive funding from Alphabet Soup. 

Results:
 •The accuracy of the original model was 72.5%. 
 • After optimizing, improvement was not achieved. The target of 75% accuracy was unable to be reached • An attempt was made on the first try to increase epochs. On the second try, another hidden layer was added. On the third try, the epochs and the values of the hidden layer nodes were adjusted. 
 • Three hidden layers were utilized. 
 • The best performance achieved during optimization was an accuracy of 72.5% and a loss of 55.7.

Summary:
Deep learning techniques, using neural networking and machine learning, can be utilized to optimize donations from Alphabet Soup. This is achieved by predicting the success of different applicants. 
An alternative model that could be used for this analysis is a decision tree, since it is much easier to implement and can be used for categorical and numerical data types. As long as the dataset is smaller and not too large or complex this can be a viable alternative for optimizing for the best sources for funding from Alphabet Soup.
